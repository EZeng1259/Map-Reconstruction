# Map Reconstruction Task 

This is a Unity project for a map reconstruction task that should be completed after the Navigation Task. The project contains instructions on how to proceed. There are 19 blocks, and the user must drag and drop the blocks onto a blank white rectangle. 
This rectangle represents the environment, and the blocks represent stores. Users must recall the locations of the stores from the Navigation Task, and then place in the location where they believe is most accurate to their memory. The coordinates of each block are then recorded. 
For each participant, the coordinates of each building are utilized to find the spatial ability for that participant.
